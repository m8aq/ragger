# Ragger

OSRS knowledge base powered by retrieval-augmented generation.

## Project Structure

- `src/ragger/` — Python package with data models and database module
- `scripts/` — Top-level orchestration (fetch_all.py, release.py, classify_game_vars.py)
- `scripts/pipeline/` — Data pipeline scripts (wiki fetch, linking, compute)
- `scripts/import/` — One-time local data imports (map squares, game vars)
- `plugin/` — RuneLite plugin with AI chat panel and Wasm scripting engine
- `tools/cache-dump/` — Java tool for extracting map data from the OSRS game cache
- `docs/` — API references, style guides, and Lua actor API docs
- `data/` — SQLite database and cache dump output (gitignored)
- `tests/` — pytest tests

## Scripts

All scripts require the package to be installed: `uv pip install -e .`

### fetch_all.py (recommended)

Runs all ingestion scripts in the correct order. Items must be populated first since other scripts reference the items table.

```sh
uv run python scripts/fetch_all.py [--db data/ragger.db] [--league DEMONIC_PACTS|RAGING_ECHOES]
```

#### Tracking a run

Each step is logged with its position, how long it took, and time elapsed so far:

```
=== [12/42] scripts/pipeline/fetch_monsters.py  (elapsed 18m 40s  eta ~41m 12s) ===
--- [12/42] fetch_monsters done in 2m 07s
```

The estimate comes from `data/build-timings.json`, written after each successful run — so the first build shows no estimate rather than a made-up one, and later builds get more accurate.

`data/build-progress.json` is rewritten after every step, so a background run can be checked without reading the log:

```sh
cat data/build-progress.json
```

It holds `state` (`running`, `failed` or `complete`), the current step number and name, seconds elapsed, and per-step durations for everything finished so far. On failure the file records exactly which step stopped the run. A completed build also prints its slowest steps with their share of total runtime.

### Pipeline scripts (`scripts/pipeline/`)

Pipeline order (managed by `fetch_all.py`):

1. `fetch_categories.py` — Crawls the wiki category graph from the Content root. Bulk-enumerates all categories via allcategories API (500/request), batch-fetches parent edges via prop=categories (50/request), filters to reachable subgraph. Populates `wiki_categories` and `wiki_category_parents`.
2. `fetch_items.py` — Pulls all item names from Category:Items
3. `fetch_currencies.py` — Pulls currencies from Category:Currency and splits them into `physical_currencies` (item-backed: Coins, Tokkul, Mark of grace, etc.) and `virtual_currencies` (varbit-backed reward counters: Slayer reward points, Carpenter points, Void Knight commendation points, etc.)
4. `fetch_equipment.py` — Pulls equipment stats (bonuses, slot, speed, combat style) and metadata from Category:Equipment (batched)
5. `fetch_quests.py` — Pulls quests with points, XP/item rewards, skill/quest/QP requirements
6. `fetch_quest_regions.py` — Parses `leagueRegion` infobox field to map quests to regions
7. `fetch_diary_tasks.py` — Pulls diary tasks with skill and quest requirements
8. `fetch_diary_items.py` — Pulls diary task item requirements from Achievement Diary page
9. `fetch_shops.py` — Pulls shop data with items, stock, pricing, and shop type from Category:Shops
10. `fetch_locations.py` — Pulls locations with adjacency graph, region, and map coordinates from Category:Locations. Infobox names are not unique (four temples all declare `name = Temple`), so a `version` disambiguator is derived from the page title and uniqueness is on `(name, version)` — matching `monsters` and `npcs`.
11. `fetch_facilities.py` — Pulls facility coordinates (banks, furnaces, anvils, altars, spinning wheels, looms)
12. `fetch_monsters.py` — Pulls monsters with full stat blocks, spawn locations, and drop tables from Category:Monsters (batched)
13. `fetch_dungeon_entrances.py` — Extracts surface-to-underground entrance/exit map links from location pages
14. `fetch_fairy_rings.py` — Parses fairy ring codes and coordinates, creates links between all 55 codes
15. `fetch_quetzal.py` — Parses Quetzal Transport System stops and creates links between all stops
16. `fetch_charter_ships.py` — Parses charter ship dock coordinates from Trader Stan's Trading Post
17. `fetch_magic_teleports.py` — Parses all spellbook teleports (Standard, Ancient, Lunar) and item teleports (jewellery, etc.)
18. `fetch_activities.py` — Pulls activities/minigames with type, coordinates, skills bitmask, and region from Category:Activities
19. `fetch_npcs.py` — Pulls non-combat NPC data (name, version, location, options, region) from Category:Non-player characters
20. `fetch_spells.py` — Fetches all spells from Category:Spells, parses {{Infobox Spell}} and {{RuneReq}}. Inserts into `combat_spells` (element, max_damage), `utility_spells`, or `teleport_spells` (destination coordinates, lectern) based on type. Rune costs resolved to item IDs in `*_spell_runes` tables.
21. `fetch_ground_items.py` — Pulls ground item spawns by finding pages using {{ItemSpawnLine}} template. Parses item name, location, members, coordinates, and league region. One row per spawn coordinate.
22. `fetch_npc_locations.py` — Associates NPC game IDs with wiki-stated coordinates by parsing versioned id and map fields from Infobox NPC
23. `fetch_actions.py` — Universal action ingestion from {{Skill table}} templates. One API call per skill expands the table and parses name, level, XP, materials, tools, facilities, and secondary skills. Entity/facility pages are batch-fetched for Infobox NPC/Scenery game IDs, with ops resolved from cache dump definitions. Replaces all individual fetch_*_actions.py scripts and trigger linking scripts. Supports `--skill` to run a single skill.
24. `fetch_wiki_vars.py` — Scrapes RuneScape:Varplayer/* and RuneScape:Varbit/* wiki pages for descriptions, content links, var class, and value annotations (quest stages, etc.)
25. `fetch_mechanics.py` — Stores game mechanics reference pages (Attack speed, Drop rate, Damage per second/*, Dragonfire, ...) whole in `wiki_pages`. These pages carry no infobox and share no structure, so there is nothing to parse into typed columns — each page is kept as raw wikitext plus a markup-stripped `text` rendering for retrieval. Defaults to `Category:Mechanics`; `--category` accepts any other category of reference prose (Calculators, Money making guides), recorded in `wiki_pages.source`.
26. `fetch_dialogues.py` — Pulls dialogue trees from Transcript: pages (namespace 120). Parses *-indented wikitext with {{topt}}, {{tcond}}, {{tact}}, {{tbox}}, {{tselect}}, {{qact}} templates into a tree in dialogue_pages + dialogue_nodes. Resolves `-> above`/`-> below`/`-> other` action references into `dialogue_nodes.continue_target_id`.
27. `fetch_page_categories.py` — Batch-fetches wiki categories for all entity pages (items, quests, monsters, NPCs, locations, equipment, activities, shops, spells) via prop=categories (50 pages/request). Links page titles to `wiki_categories` rows in `page_categories`.
28. `link_shop_locations.py` — Links shops to locations by matching location text
29. `link_activity_locations.py` — Links activities to locations by matching location text
30. `link_ground_item_locations.py` — Links ground items to items (name normalization) and nearest locations (Chebyshev distance)
31. `link_facilities.py` — Derives facility bitmasks on locations from nearest facility coordinates
32. `link_dialogue_entities.py` — Refines `[display](wiki:Page)` markdown links in `dialogue_nodes.text` to typed entity prefixes (`npc:`, `item:`, `quest:`, `monster:`, `location:`, `shop:`, `activity:`, `equipment:`) by looking each slug up against the entity tables. Anything not found stays as `wiki:` for downstream fallback resolution.
33. `compute_dialogue_tags.py` — Aho-Corasick entity tagging over dialogue nodes. Matches items, NPCs, monsters, quests, locations, shops, equipment, and activities. Stores probable links in dialogue_tags.
34. `compute_dialogue_instructions.py` — Flattens each dialogue tree into a linear per-page instruction stream, runs the canonical pass pipeline (lower_gotos → thread_jumps → inline_player_echoes → fold_select_menu → compact), writes to dialogue_instructions. Implementation lives in `src/ragger/dialogue/`.
35. `link_npc_dialogues.py` — Links NPCs to dialogue pages by exact name match on npc-type transcripts
36. `link_quest_dialogues.py` — Links quests to dialogue pages by exact name match on quest-type transcripts
37. `compute_blobs.py` — Flood fills each Voronoi cell under the full directional collision model (walls, water, void, diagonal corner rules) and assigns each maximal walkable region a global blob ID. Writes per-tile blob labels as 16-bit PNG map squares of `MapSquareType.BLOB` and records per-blob owner + tile count in the `blobs` table.
38. `compute_ports.py` — Samples each Voronoi ridge and looks up the walkable blob on each side (offsetting normal to the ridge). Contiguous samples sharing the same `(blob_a, blob_b)` pair collapse into a port pair (one row per side) in the `ports` table, linking the ridge to the blob it touches on each side.
39. `compute_port_transits.py` — For each blob touched by ≥2 ports, BFS from each port's representative tile through the blob under the full directional collision model to all other same-blob ports. Writes Chebyshev-step distances as edges in the `port_transits` table.
40. `compute_port_crossings.py` — Self-joins ports on `(ridge_a, ridge_b, sample_start, sample_end)` with side mismatch to pair up A-side and B-side ports of the same segment, then BFS-validates each pair is walkably reachable within 20 tiles. Writes directed crossing edges (src, dst, true tile distance) into the `port_crossings` table.
41. `compute_map_link_blobs.py` — Resolves each `map_links` row's `(src_x, src_y)` and `(dst_x, dst_y)` endpoints to blob IDs via a small-radius nearest-walkable scan. Populates `map_links.src_blob_id` / `dst_blob_id` so the pathfinder can inject portal endpoints into the port graph as virtual nodes without rescanning the blob raster per query.

### Import scripts (`scripts/import/`)

- `import_map_squares.py` — Imports map square images from `data/map-squares.zip` into the `map_squares` table. One-time setup.
- `import_game_vars.py` — Imports game var JSON from `data/game-vars/` (produced by `dumpGameVars`) into the `game_vars` table. Re-run after updating RuneLite.
- `import_object_locations.py` — Imports interactive object spawn locations from `data/cache-dump/object-locations.json` (produced by `dumpObjectLocations`) into the `object_locations` table.

### smoke_test.py — validate every step before a full build

A full build takes about an hour and `fetch_all.py` stops at the first failing script, so a mistake in step 30 only surfaces after 45 minutes of fetching. `smoke_test.py` runs every step with the page lists capped and **keeps going after a failure**, so one run surfaces every broken step.

```sh
uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py [--pages 15] [--db data/smoke.db] [--from-step fetch_npcs]
```

Roughly 3.5 minutes for all 46 steps. Run it after touching any pipeline script.

It works through two environment variables, which are also usable directly:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RAGGER_MAX_PAGES=N` | Caps `fetch_category_members`, `fetch_template_users` and `enumerate_var_pages` to N pages. Every large step draws its work list from one of these; steps driven by upstream tables shrink automatically because their inputs do. |
| `RAGGER_SKIP_ATTRIBUTION=1` | Skips contributor and redirect lookups — pure network calls with no parsing to exercise. |

This is **not** a correctness check. With 15 pages per category most cross-references will not resolve, so low or zero row counts are expected. What it proves is that every script runs, parses, and writes without raising.

**A real build always fetches everything.** Both variables default to off, and `fetch_all.py` refuses to start if either is set — otherwise a stray environment variable would silently produce a truncated database while every step reported success. Use `smoke_test.py` for sampling; `fetch_all.py` is all-or-nothing.

`--from-step` resumes partway through and implies `--keep`, since the skipped steps are exactly the ones that populate the tables the later steps read. The three cache-import scripts always run regardless, because they take about two seconds and skipping them makes every compute step fail for reasons unrelated to the code under test.

Steps listed in `CAP_SENSITIVE` are reported as `skip` rather than `FAIL` because they look up specific hardcoded entities that a small sample will not contain — `fetch_npc_transports` needs the NPCs that operate transports to be among the fetched `npc_locations` rows. Steps in `STEP_ARGS` get extra narrowing flags (`fetch_actions` runs a single skill).

### Utility scripts

- `classify_game_vars.py` — Classifies game variable names using Claude CLI. Tags vars with content categories and functional tags. Supports `--workers`, `--batch-size`, `--session-reset`, `--model`, `--reclassify` flags.
- `validate_wiki_cache.py` — Bulk-validates wiki cache revids against current wiki state. Bumps `fetched_at` on fresh entries, evicts stale ones. Run before ingestion to avoid per-page revid checks. Supports `--cache` flag.

`fetch_league_tasks.py` is in `scripts/pipeline/` but run separately via `fetch_all.py --league`. The script takes a `League` enum name (`RAGING_ECHOES`, `DEMONIC_PACTS`) and stamps every inserted row with that league, so multiple league catalogs can coexist. Re-running it for a league cascades-deletes that league's existing tasks and requirement-group rows before reinserting.

## Cache Dump Tool

Java tool in `tools/cache-dump/` that extracts map data and game constants from the OSRS game cache and RuneLite API. Automatically downloads the latest cache from [OpenRS2](https://archive.openrs2.org/).

Requires JDK 21+. Run from `tools/cache-dump/`:

```sh
# Dump collision maps (red = blocked, white = walkable)
./gradlew dumpCollision [--args="--plane 0 --output ../../data/cache-dump/collision"]

# Dump water masks (blue = water, transparent = land)
./gradlew dumpWater [--args="--plane 0 --output ../../data/cache-dump/water"]

# Dump rendered map tiles (terrain + walls, no objects/icons)
./gradlew dumpMapTiles [--args="--objects --icons --no-walls"]

# Dump game variable constants (varps, varbits, varcs) to JSON
./gradlew dumpGameVars [--args="--output ../../data/game-vars"]

# Dump NPC definitions (id, name, size, combatLevel, ops, conditionalOps) to JSON
./gradlew dumpNpcDefinitions [--args="--output ../../data/cache-dump/npc-definitions.json"]

# Dump object definitions (id, name, sizeX, sizeY, ops, conditionalOps) to JSON
./gradlew dumpObjectDefinitions [--args="--output ../../data/cache-dump/object-definitions.json"]

# Dump interactive object spawn locations (objects with menu ops) to JSON
./gradlew dumpObjectLocations [--args="--output ../../data/cache-dump/object-locations.json"]
```

Output: `data/cache-dump/{collision,water,map-tiles}/{plane}_{rx}_{ry}.png`
Output: `data/cache-dump/{npc,object}-definitions.json`
Output: `data/cache-dump/object-locations.json`
Output: `data/game-vars/{varp,varbit,varc_int}.json`

### DumpMapTiles flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--walls` / `--no-walls` | on | Wall outlines |
| `--overlays` / `--no-overlays` | on | Overlay textures (paths, floors) |
| `--objects` / `--no-objects` | off | Trees, rocks, buildings, scenery |
| `--icons` / `--no-icons` | off | Map icons (bank, altar, etc.) |
| `--labels` / `--no-labels` | off | Text labels |
| `--transparent` | off | Transparent background |
| `--plane N` | 0 | Which plane to render |

All tools accept `--cache <path>` to use a local cache directory instead of downloading.

### release.py

Creates a GitHub release with the database, map squares, and CREDITS.md attached. Auto-commits updated CREDITS.md before tagging.

```sh
uv run python scripts/release.py [version] [--notes "..."]
```

Version defaults to the `VERSION` file.

All fetch scripts share utilities from `src/ragger/wiki.py` (API constants, category enumeration, wikitext fetching, template parsing, requirement linking, attribution).

### Attribution

All scripts that fetch wiki data **must** record attributions. Use `record_attributions_batch()` for scripts that fetch many pages (batches contributor lookups 50 pages per API call) or `fetch_page_wikitext_with_attribution()` for single-page fetches. Attributions are stored in the `attributions` table and used to generate CREDITS.md on release.

### API etiquette

- Default throttle is 1 request/second (override locally via `RAGGER_THROTTLE` in `.env`)
- Prefer batched API calls where possible — `fetch_contributors_batch()` handles up to 50 pages per call
- User-Agent includes project URL per wiki API policy
- Wikitext must be fetched one page at a time (`action=parse`), but contributor lookups support batching (`action=query`)
- Wiki page cache: set `RAGGER_WIKI_CACHE=data/wiki-cache.db` to cache wikitext in a separate SQLite database. Cache entries within the TTL (default 24 hours, override with `RAGGER_WIKI_TTL` in seconds) are trusted without revid checks. Stale entries are re-validated via a cheap revid-only API call. Run `scripts/validate_wiki_cache.py` to bulk-validate all cached revids and reset their TTL. `WikiCache` class can also be passed directly to fetch functions via the `cache` parameter.
- Incremental sync (designed, not yet implemented): `docs/INCREMENTAL_SYNC.md` describes how to cut warm rebuilds from ~60 to ~15 minutes by syncing the cache from the wiki's recentchanges feed and caching contributor/redirect lookups, instead of re-fetching everything per build.

## Database

Default path: `data/ragger.db`. All scripts accept `--db` to override.

Tables are created automatically when any script runs. Only `fetch_items.py` writes to the items table — all other scripts reference it.

### Uniqueness and re-runs

Most fetch scripts insert with `INSERT OR IGNORE`, which only skips a row when it would violate a uniqueness constraint. A table without such a constraint silently accumulates duplicates on every re-run, so any table whose rows are fully described by their own columns should declare one.

Where a key column is nullable, uniqueness must be an expression index over `COALESCE` sentinels rather than a plain `UNIQUE (...)` — SQLite treats NULLs as distinct, so two rows differing only by a NULL would not collide. `map_links`, `facilities`, `monster_drops` and `action_triggers` use this form; `diary_tasks` has no nullable key columns and uses a plain constraint.

`actions` deliberately has no uniqueness constraint. Several actions share a name, members flag and tick count while differing only in their `action_input_items` rows (24 distinct recipes all produce "Fish offcuts"), so the parent row is not a key.

There is no migration system. `create_tables` uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it will not add columns or constraints to an existing database — and creating a unique index over data that already contains duplicates fails outright. Schema changes require rebuilding from scratch.

## Lua Actor API

Per-API reference docs in `docs/lua/` — one file per Lua global available to actors. Read the relevant files before writing actor code. See `BASE.md` in the plugin resources for the full API directory listing.

### MCP Server

Python MCP server at `src/ragger/mcp_server.py` exposes the following tools:

- `ActorSpawn(name, script)` — submit a persistent Lua actor to the plugin
- `Eval(script)` — evaluate a Lua expression and return the result
- `ActorList()` — list active actors
- `ActorSource(name)` — retrieve a running actor's source code
- `TemplateList()` — list registered templates
- `TemplateSource(name)` — retrieve a template's source code
- `MailSend(name, messages)` — send one or more messages to a single actor's `on_mail` hook
